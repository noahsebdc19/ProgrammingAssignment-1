# ProgrammingAssignment-1
In this assignment, we will learn the fundamental codes and functions used in Python programming. The goal is not just to understand how these codes work, but to put them into practice. We'll use them to create simple Python programs, which will give us a hands-on experience and a deeper understanding.
